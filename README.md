Rust parser for [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) .vox files, using
[Nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom).

## Current status

I'm not currently using MagicaVoxel, so am not keeping up with developments in the file format. If there are any
missing features, or problems loading more recent files, please don't hesitate to open an issue. I'll try to get back
to you within a day or two!

## RustDoc

Kindly hosted over at https://docs.rs/dot_vox/.
